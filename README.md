# Conectame

This is the presentation for the Social Impact Hackathon (Puerto Rico) 2017.  We designed a mobile app that matches Hurricane Maria survivors with service providers and generates optimized delivery routes to remote areas. I contributed in writing the algorithms, designing the mobile interface, presentation and business model. 

Our team won the grand prize!
